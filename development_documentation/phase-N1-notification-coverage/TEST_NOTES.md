# Test Notes: Phase N1 — Notification/Email Automation & Multi-Channel Ingestion

## Scope

Fixes a stack of three root-cause gaps causing notification-based transactions to fail parsing, duplicate, or go unmatched:

- **N1 (Parser rule corrections)**: Extended `BsnParserRule` with DuitNow direction keywords ("DuitNow to" + "successful"), added BSN-specific merchant regex for DuitNow recipient names. Extended `MaybankParserRule` to match `com.maybank2u.m2u` (legacy app) and title fallback `"Maybank2u"`. Extended `CimbParserRule` to match `my.com.cimb.octo` and title fallback `"CIMB"`.
- **N2 (Aggregator-forward recognition)**: New `AggregatorForwardMatcher` utility in `core-parsing/.../util/`. Accepts a set of aggregator packages (not hardcoded to Gmail) and bank-specific subject markers. Wired into BSN, Maybank, and CIMB parser rules via Koin.
- **N3 (Cross-channel dedup)**: New `transaction_corroboration` table (8.sqm + migrations/2.sqm). New `findLikelyDuplicate` SQLDelight query on `transaction_record` with index `idx_tx_dedup` on `(account_id, amount, timestamp)`. `TransactionRepository.attachCorroboratingSource()` records the corroboration without changing the existing transaction. Dedup check inserted in `SciuroIngestionOrchestrator.processOneEvent` before booking — same-direction, ±RM0.01, within 90s window catches the second source and attaches it as evidence.
- **N4a (Tight-match auto-confirm)**: `TransferDetectionEngine` now tries a 15-second tight match (no `isPairConfirmed` gate) before falling through to the existing 120-second heuristic path requiring pair confirmation. This bootstraps the `account_pair_confirmation` table automatically on the first DuitNow self-transfer.
- **N4b (Linked Accounts settings)**: New `LinkedAccountsScreen` composable + `LinkedAccountsViewModel` + `LinkedAccountsUiState` sealed interface. Multi-select of own accounts, "Link selected pair" button calls `AccountRepository.linkAccountPair()` which directly seeds `account_pair_confirmation`. Wired into settings navigation in `MainActivity`.
- **N5 (LLM-fallback candidate logging)**: `SimulationResult` exposes `llmPackageMarker` when a simulation falls back to LLM with no matched rule. `DeveloperTabDiagnostics` now displays a "LLM-Fallback Candidate" card with the package name and redacted text — a starting point for future rule authors.

### Pre-requisite fix
- **P0**: Fixed `TransferDetectionEngineTest.kt` — the test was constructing `TransferDetectionEngine(database, transferRepository)` with 2 args but the engine's constructor required 3 (`database, transferRepository, eventBus`). Now passes `DomainEventBus()`. Extracted `FakeAuditRepository` into `TestDatabase.kt` for reuse by the dedup tests.

- [PASS] All 31 existing fixture regression tests (7 parser rules) — no regressions.

- [PASS] BSN DuitNow outflow (new): direction=OUTFLOW, amount=5.40, merchant="MUHAMMAD NAIM N"

### `detekt`

- [PASS] NO-SOURCE on root project (pre-existing configuration limitation — detekt is not configured per-module). No new warnings from manual code review.

## Follow-up: Notification capture-layer defect fix (bigText/textLines fallback)

After the N1 phase shipped, two real-world capture traces revealed a gap:
- Maybank2u Scan & Pay notifications (`CAPTURE → DROP {reason=blank_content}`) — the app posts with `EXTRA_TEXT` empty and the real content only in `EXTRA_BIG_TEXT`.
- Gmail forwards (`PARSE_LLM → FAILURE`, reasoning "lacks sufficient information") — the LLM was only seeing the truncated `EXTRA_TEXT` preview, never the full body in `EXTRA_TEXT_LINES`.

### Fix

`SciuroNotificationService.resolveText()` now reads all three extras fields with the priority chain `bigText > textLines > shortText`, ensuring the richest available content is always captured. The pure fallback logic was extracted to `NotificationTextResolver.resolveTextFallback()` in `commonMain` for testability.

### Diagnostic improvement

On the `blank_content` drop path, the trace now records `extras_present` (joined set of extras key names), e.g.:
```
{"reason":"blank_content","package":"com.maybank2u.life","extras_present":"android.title,android.bigText"}
```
This makes the fix immediately legible from the trace alone — no source read needed.

### Regression fixtures

Three new `FixtureLibrary` entries reproducing the exact captured payloads:

| Fixture | Package | Content type |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Maybank2u Scan & Pay outflow (bigText-only) | `com.maybank2u.life` | `EXTRA_BIG_TEXT` only |
| Maybank2u Scan & Pay inflow (bigText-only) | `com.maybank2u.life` | `EXTRA_BIG_TEXT` only |
| Gmail Maybank forward (truncated preview) | `com.google.android.gm` | `EXTRA_TEXT_LINES` > `EXTRA_TEXT` |

### Test results — 27 July 2026

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| `NotificationTextResolverTest` (6 cases, commonTest) — all branches of fallback chain | PASS |
| `:core-ingestion:commonTest` — no regressions | PASS |
| `runAllFixtures()` — Maybank2u outflow/inflow + Gmail fixtures now produce non-blank text | PASS |

### Adjacent: SmsReceiver consolidation

`SmsReceiver.kt` previously had its own local `hasFinancialSignal` block (7 keywords, lowercase substring match) instead of calling the shared `AggregatorHeuristicFilter.isFinancial()` (22 keywords, word-boundary regex). Consolidated to use the shared filter, ensuring consistent financial signal detection across both notification and SMS channels.

## Known gaps

- JVM target `:core-transfer:jvmTest` fails on JDK 21 due to `:core-audit:compileKotlinJvm` ("Unknown Kotlin JVM target: 21"). This is a pre-existing environment issue (Kotlin 1.9.0 does not support JDK 21 as a compilation target). Android-side unit tests (`:core-transfer:testDebugUnitTest`) use the Android device platform and do not hit this.
- The dedup and tight-match tests are Android-side only for this reason; full JVM integration test suite requires either a JDK downgrade or Kotlin version bump.
- N4b `LinkedAccountsScreen` Compose UI is not covered by automated Compose UI tests (no Compose testing framework set up in this project per previous phase notes). Manual dogfood is the established verification pattern.
- The `findLikelyDuplicate` query filters on `(direction, amount, timestamp)` but uses `ABS()` which prevents index-only scans. The `idx_tx_dedup` index on `(account_id, amount, timestamp)` is a best-effort hint — SQLite may still require a table scan for the ABS() computation. For a personal-finance workload (<1k transactions per year per user), this is not a performance concern.
